# ja3_fingerprinting
This repository shows that while JA3(S) fingerprinting is really useful to maintain a fingerprint database of clients/serverts in a controlled environment, identifying individual Web services in the wild, however, is not trivial and sometimes provides the same fingerprint for different services or different fingerprints for the same services.
Although, the latter is somewhat expected as JA3(S) fingerprints are also depending on the corresponding JA3 fingerprint, i.e., the Server Hello (and its particular content) is depending on the triggering Client Hello. However, if both are "the same", they produce the same pair of fingerprints in every case...but there is a catch: if services are behind a load-balancer Server Hellos might be generated by different servers for the same client depending on how the particular servers are configured (i.e., which OS is running, which version of libraries and applications are used, etc.).

## Btw., what is JA3(S) fingerprinting?
TL;DR - A JA3 hash represents the fingerprint of an SSL/TLS client application that allows for simple and effective detection of client applications such as Chrome running on OSX (JA3=94c485bca29d5392be53f2b8cf7f4304) or the Dyre malware family running on Windows (JA3=b386946a5a44d1ddcc843bc75336dfce) or Metasploitâ€™s Meterpreter running on Linux (JA3=5d65ea3fb1d4aa7d826733d2f2cbbb1d). JA3 allows us to detect these applications, malware families, and pen testing tools, regardless of their destination, Command and Control (C2) IPs, or SSL certificates.

## Requirements for reproducing
The scripts heavily depend on the python library `dpkt`. The easiest way to get it is as follows:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dpkt
```
The rest of the requirements are probably installed by default on your system. If not, please refer to the `import` section of the source file and install all required libraries accordingly.


## Are fingeprints unique enough
Here, we quickly show (in a reproducible way) that JA3S fingerprints can be the same for multiple services.

In the sources you will find a pcap file, called `fingerprint_test.pcap`. 
Using the script `ja3.py`, or more precisely `ja3s.py` for server fingerprinting, and filtering on a specific IP for presentational purposes, we get the following output:
```
$ python3 ja3s.py -j |grep "104.16.248.249" -B 1
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "104.16.248.249",

        "ja3_digest": "2b0648ab686ee45e0e7c35fcfb0eea7e",

        "ja3_digest": "2b0648ab686ee45e0e7c35fcfb0eea7e",
        "source_ip": "104.16.248.249",

        "ja3_digest": "2b0648ab686ee45e0e7c35fcfb0eea7e",
        "source_ip": "104.16.248.249",
```
As you can see, the Cloudflare's DoH resolver's `ServerHello` (`source_ip: 104.16.248.249`) is present several times in the pcap, however, not always with the same JA3S hash.

Okay, now check whether two different services have the same JA3S fingerprint.
Let's pick the following fingerprint: `eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054`.
```
$ python3 filters/ja3s.py fingerprint_test.pcap  -j|grep "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054" -A 1
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "172.217.194.103",
--
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "104.16.248.249",
--
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "104.16.248.249",
--
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "74.125.200.95",
--
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "74.125.200.95",
--
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "74.125.200.95",
--
        "ja3_digest": "eb1d94daa7e0344597e756a1fb6e7054",
        "source_ip": "74.125.200.95",
```
Here, you can observe that this JA3S hash is "shared" among different services, namely between Cloudflare's DoH resolver (`104.16.248.249`) and one of the Google services (`74.125.200.95`)


Naively addig more metadata, e.g., IP addresses, for the hash generation would resolve this specific latter issue, however, it would lose the aim of the original JA3(S) fingerprints that is to identify services independently on L4/L3/L2 information.
However, as a naive test I have made this small change and stored it as `ja3s_srcip.py`.
